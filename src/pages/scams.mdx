## Scam Baiters

A scam baiter, also known as an Internet scam baiter or simply a baiter, is an individual who actively engages with scammers and online fraudsters with the intention of wasting their time, gathering information about their operations, and raising awareness about scams. Scam baiters typically pose as potential victims, using fake personas and email addresses to attract scammers.

The primary objective of scam baiters is to prevent scammers from targeting real victims and potentially causing financial or emotional harm. By engaging with scammers and leading them on, baiters disrupt their operations, making it more difficult for them to find actual victims and reducing their effectiveness.

Scam baiters often document their interactions with scammers, recording email exchanges, phone calls, or chat conversations, and then share these interactions publicly on websites, forums, or social media platforms. Through this process, they expose the tactics and techniques used by scammers, helping others recognize and avoid falling prey to similar scams.

It’s important to note that scam baiting carries certain risks, and it should be done with caution. Engaging with scammers can lead to potential retaliation or personal data exposure, so individuals interested in scam baiting should take appropriate precautions and avoid revealing any personal information during the interactions.
